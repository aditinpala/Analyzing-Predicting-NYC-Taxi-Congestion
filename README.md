# Analyzing-Predicting-NYC-Taxi-Congestion

I analyzed New York City's taxi industry with Python, extracting insights from a vast dataset of over 8 million records. This project demonstrates my expertise in data cleansing, exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling, shedding light on the industry's behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Key Highlights:

1. Conducted data cleaning and exploratory analysis on an 8-million-record dataset using NumPy and pandas, uncovering trends in payment methods (cash vs. cashless) during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
2. Employed seaborn and matplotlib libraries to craft visualizations illustrating the fluctuation of surge prices throughout the day and its impact on ride booking rates in New York City.

3. Developed an XGBoost regression model with the scikit-learn library to predict congestion surcharge based on pickup and drop-off locations and ride booking density. Achieved a mean square error of 2.2 and a root mean square error of 1.42.
